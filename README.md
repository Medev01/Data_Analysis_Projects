# Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio, where you can find a collection of my past and ongoing data analysis projects. As a data-driven professional, I have a passion for extracting insights and telling stories with data. In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and communication.

## About Me
My name is Mohamed ouahlou, and I am a Master student with University Mohamed 5. I have 1 year of experience in data analysis and have worked with a range of tools and technologies, including Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I am always looking to expand my skillset and take on new challenges, so please feel free to reach out if you have any project ideas or collaborations in mind.

## Projects
Below, you'll find a list of my current and past projects, including a brief description and relevant code and visualizations. Each project showcases my ability to:

Collect and clean large datasets
Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights
Communicate findings through compelling data visualizations
## Project 1: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering Algorithm

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a critical strategy in marketing and business to understand different customer groups' behaviors and preferences. By segmenting customers, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to better meet the unique needs of each segment.

## Project 2: Space Missions EDA

This project aims to analyze and explore a dataset containing information about space missions. 
By conducting exploratory data analysis, we seek to gain insights into the history and trends of space exploration.

Objectives

- Explore the dataset and clean the data as needed.
- Visualize key statistics and trends in space missions.
- Answer questions related to space missions.
- Share interesting findings and visualizations.

Dataset


The dataset used for this analysis can be found (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=2&pageSize=5).
It contains information about space missions, including launch dates, missions objectives, spacecraft details, and more.


 Dataset Description

All **space missions from 1957 to August 2022**, including details on the location,
date, and result of the launch, the company responsible, and the name, price, 
and status of the rocket used for the mission.

- Company : name of the company
- location : the exact location of the mission
- Rocket : name of the Rocke used for mission 
- statusRocket : status of rocket ( is it Retired or active )
- country : the country 
- Date : date of mission 
- MissionStatus : is it Success    or Failure or Partial Failure or Prelaunch Failure

Insights

1. Mission Success Rate: The overall success rate of space missions has improved over the years, with a noticeable increase in the late 20th century.

2. Most Common Objectives: The most common objectives of space missions include Earth observation, satellite deployment, and planetary exploration.

3. Popular Launch Vehicles : The dataset reveals that certain launch vehicles are preferred for space missions.


Conclusion

This exploratory data analysis provides valuable insights into the world of space missions.
By examining historical data, we can see how space exploration has evolved over time, 
the objectives that have been pursued, and the missions' success rates. These findings can be used to inform future space mission planning and research.

## Project 4: Sales Product Analysis in the USA
In this project, I analyzed sales data for a product in the USA using Python to gain insights into customer behavior and identify opportunities for growth.

### Objectives:

- Analyze sales data to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior
- Develop a predictive model to forecast future sales
- Identify opportunities for growth and recommend actions to improve sales

### Methods:

- Collected and cleaned the sales data from various sources, including databases and spreadsheets
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in the data
- Used data visualization techniques to communicate findings and insights to stakeholders
  
### Results:

Identified a positive correlation between price and sales, indicating that a price increase could lead to increased sales
Found that sales were highest in the Northeast region and lowest in the Southwest region, indicating a potential opportunity for growth in the Southwest
Developed a predictive model that accurately forecasted future sales within a 5% margin of error
Created data visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, to communicate findings and insights to stakeholders

### Skills Used:

- Python programming language
- Data analysis and visualization libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data manipulation and cleaning
